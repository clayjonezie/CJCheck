Some super simple testing methods in Java. No news is good news. 

USAGE: 'Check.check("a string describing value", found, expected);'
Where found and expected are both primatives of the same type. 
Support for objects soon. Don't hold your breath.

Oh, and for doubles throw an epsilon on the end if you want. If your into that kind of thing.
